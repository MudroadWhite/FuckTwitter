The simplest code to remove Twitter promos

This repository serves as my simple Tampermonkey based Twitter promo remover script to make my timeline clean.

Pros:
- Easy to read code.
- Easy configuration, easy hack. So easy, wow
- I have tried other snippets I can find on TM(not Github, yet). It's someone else's work, and I modified a little to step further to its perfection, so I can say it works out the best as far as I can see, and have completely cleaned up my homepage. At this time, it really doesn't matter how well your code is being systemmatic and analytic.

Cons:
- English interface only
- Occasional timeline shaking, due to the constant fight between the remover and the remover-defender from Twitter. 
- Potential normal Tweet removing

Note: The defender will add back all the missing promos and tweet recommends every some short time. Therefore, if the callback time has been set too slowly, you'll find tweet recommends coming back to annoy you.

Note2: I'm planning to find a way to check the Twitter's script, and prohibit its defender from working, in the very future when I'm happy. Wish me good luck!
